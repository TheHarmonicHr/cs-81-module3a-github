# Reflection on Git & GitHub

**What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?**  
I learned how to use Git to track changes, create commits for each feature, and push those commits to GitHub. I also figured out how to use a personal access token instead of a password. Something that wasn't very clear in the beginning because I kept typing my password but it wasn't appearing in the terminal.

**What was most confusing or frustrating?**  
Setting up Git authentication with GitHub. It wasn’t obvious that I needed a personal access token and not my actual password. That caused a few failed attempts, but once it clicked, it felt straightforward. It felt like magic when it finally worked.

**Why do you think developers use Git?**  
It helps manage changes, track progress, and collaborate without breaking everything. You can roll back mistakes and organize features cleanly. It’s also essential for working on teams and keeping codebases clean and understandable.

**How might this help with larger projects in the future?**  
Git will help me manage files, coordinate with teammates, and keep a history of what changed and why. It's like a digital memory bank for code.

**Personal Insight:**  
Honestly, I’m fascinated with the simplest of processes. The ability to create files from the computer’s terminal is probably my favorite part of this entire experience. There's something powerful and intimate about interacting with your machine on that level—it makes the act of building feel tangible and direct. I love watching these applications and systems communicate with one another.
